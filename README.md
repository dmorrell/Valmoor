Mud built in Python

This is my first upload to GitHub. I built this MUD while learning Python from the book "Hello!, Python" by Anthony Briggs. 
Great book for anyone that wants to learn Python. I used to play a lof of MUDs 20+ years ago so it was a lot fun writing this and getting my kids to play. It was built in rambling fashion as I added features/functions so I'll be going back now to clean it up. Particularly the various classes and some better logic around a few of the methods that were done more brute force.

You'll need to have Twisted installed to make it work   https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/


Enjoy!

Cheers
